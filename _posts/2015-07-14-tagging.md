Last month I made a presentation on different tagging algorithmsseems. Designing such algorithms seems no longer an active research, but during that time I was trying to cracking the code of <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/tagger-0">Haploview Tagger</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/lybird300/Haploview/tree/master/edu/mit/wi/tagger">Java code</a> has not been updated since 7 years ago.
Anyway, here is <a href="https://lybird300.github.io/YLin_July8_2015_TagSNPSelection.pdf">the PDF version of my slide deck</a>.
