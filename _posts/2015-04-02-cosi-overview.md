The bestfit model

This model has been calibrated using genome-wide human population data for different populations. It uses the large-scale variation in recombination rates obtained from the deCODE genetic map along with fine-scale variation in recombination rates. The default parameters of this model are listed in Table 1 of the paper describing the method (Schaffner et al., 2005). The program generates data for four populations, each with its own demographic scenario.
