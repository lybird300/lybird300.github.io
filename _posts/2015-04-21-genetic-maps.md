In genetics, a centimorgan (abbreviated cM) or map unit (m.u.) is a unit of recombinant frequency for measuring genetic linkage. It is often used to imply distance along a chromosome. The number of base-pairs it corresponds to varies widely across the genome (different regions of a chromosome have different propensities towards crossover). One centimorgan is equal to a 1% chance that a marker at one genetic locus on a chromosome will be separated from a marker at a second locus due to crossing over in a single generation. In human genome, 1 centimorgan on average represents a distance of about 7.5x10E5 base pairs.
