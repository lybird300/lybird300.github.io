This post may seem a little off the track. Some of us in our group hold a book club met every other week to learn traditional geentic analysis. We are using the first edition of a classic textbook -- "Introduction to genetic analysis", whose up-to-date edition is 11th. Club members take turns leading the discussion of chapters. It's soon going to be my turn and the chapter is about mutation. So I figure why not open a new post on this topic as I prepare for it.
