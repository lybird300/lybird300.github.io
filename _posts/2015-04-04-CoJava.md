Daniel was Kirk's doctoral student who suddently and unexpectedly passed away three months ago (<a href="http://www.smithfuneralhomebroadway.com/fh/obituaries/obituary.cfm?o_id=2902785&fh_id=13749">Orbituray for Daniel</a>). He has rewritten Cosi in Java and greatly improved its performance. You can find a recent version of CoJava on <a href="https://github.com/dtgillis/Cojava">Dan's github site</a>. If you, like me, are not familiar with the basic ideas and terminology, welcome to <a href="https://github.com/lybird300/CoJava_linly_nov13">my copy of Daniel's codes with layman's commentary</a>.

Daniel also incorporated chromosome anomalies into cosi, so CoJava is capable of...inversion, insertion, deletion.
