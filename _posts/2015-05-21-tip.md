<h2>Eclipse Java IDE (Luna)</h2>
To edit files side-by-side in Eclipse (e.g., reference one file while working on another), click on the tab of one of the files you want to edit and drag the tab to the edge of the editor frame until you see a vertical line appear in the middle of the editor frame. Then drop the tab there and you have two files to view side-by-side.
