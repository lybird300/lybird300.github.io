Today I start poking into COSI. The two main reasons for wanting to simulate genetic data are, first, to gain insight into the effects that underlying demographic and mutational parameters may have on the genetic data one sees, and, secondly, to create test datasets for assessing the power of alternative genetic analysis methods.

The key challenges that all simulation algorithms face are: (1) speed — typically one wants to do lots of simulations, so they need to be fast; (2) scalability — with the advent of genome-wide genotyping and large-scale sequencing, there is a need for simulation programs to match; and (3) flexibility — can the program cope with different demographic histories, population structure, recombination, selection, mutation models and disease models?
