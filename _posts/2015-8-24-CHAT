Today I'm starting this post to record my thoughts while looking into Kirk's self-written software -- CHAT. Although I don't know (a) how often I will update, (b) how useful the content will be, or (c) how long it will take to complete the post, it is pretty exiting that after almost 5 months I'm finally here! ^_^

First of all, let me give you an official description of CHAT (Convergent Haplotype Association Tagging). CHAT is a computer program that we are developing to detect rare moderate penetrant mutations from GWA data sets. The core of this method is a graph-theory based algorithm that systematically searches for subsets of individuals that share long range haplotypes. The underlying assumption is that a small (but significant) subset of unrelated individuals have the same disease because they have inherited a moderate penetrant mutation from a distant common ancestor. Since the algorithm is computationally intensive (an NP-complete problem), we have been cooperating with the Renaissance Computational Institute (RENCI) and using their high-performance computing clusters. Our previous work showed the success of CHAT in constructed and simulated data sets as well as real data sets. The program has been applied in several independent projects to search for the genetic basis (i.e., causal mutations) of and treatment targets for diseases such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, alcoholism, multiple sclerosis, lymphoid cancer, and lung cancer and smoking. We found that CHAT is more likely to be successful with phenotypes that have lower population prevalence. The next step is to test CHAT using additional real data sets as they become available. Our goal is to help establish the baseline rate for detecting clusters of individuals with long shared haplotypes and to establish collaboration to resequence several genes for a few subjects. Fancy, right? CHAT is sort of a legend in our group, as Kirk has been working on it alone for 6+ years in his spare time. Now he's working with me and Charles on publicating this work.
