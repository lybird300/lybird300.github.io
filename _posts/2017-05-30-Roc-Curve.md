False-positive rate (FPR) = FP / N, where N = TN + FP; FPR = 1 â€“ specificity
True-positive rate (TPR) = TP / P, where P = TP + FN; TPR = sensitivity

As long as you can get a set of FPR and TPR values (by sweeping through the range of your statistic picking continuously changing values as corresponding thresholds), you would be able to do everything introduced in this post.
