Most of current molecular genotyping techniques mix DNA pieces from two complementary chromosomes and only provide genotypes of diploid (mixture of haplotypes). Such results lead to haplotypic ambiguity/uncertainty when ≥2 makers/loci are heterozygous and their genetic phase is unknown.
Some molecular techniques can directly measure haplotypes, but expensive (money, labor, time ….), especially for genome-wide study. Thus, currently researchers heavily rely on i
