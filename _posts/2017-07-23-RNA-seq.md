<h2>Basics</h2>
“Read” refers to both single-end or paired-end reads. The concept of counting is the same with either type of read, as each read represents a fragment that was sequenced. “Feature” refers to an expression feature, which is a genomic region containing a sequence that can normally appear in an RNA-Seq experiment (e.g. gene, isoform, exon).
In the rest of this post, the random variable X_i to denote the counts you observe from a feature of interest i. With alternative splicing you do not directly observe X_i, so often E[X_i] is used, which is estimated using the EM algorithm by a method like eXpress, RSEM, Sailfish, Cufflinks, or one of many other tools.

<h2>RNA-seq expression measures</h2>
It used to be when you did RNA-seq, you reported your results in RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase Million) or FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase Million). FPKM is very similar to RPKM. RPKM was made for single-end RNA-seq, where every read corresponded to a single fragment that was sequenced. FPKM was made for paired-end RNA-seq. With paired-end RNA-seq, two reads can correspond to a single fragment, or, if one read in the pair did not map, one read can correspond to a single fragment. The only difference between RPKM and FPKM is that FPKM takes into account that two reads can map to one fragment (and so it doesn’t c ount this fragment twice).

The calculation of RPKM
<ol>
<li>Count up the total reads in a sample and divide that number by 1,000,000 – this is our “per million” scaling factor.</li>
<li>Divide the read counts by the “per million” scaling factor. This normalizes for sequencing depth, giving you reads per million (RPM).</li>
<li>Divide the RPM values by the length of the gene, in kilobases. This gives you RPKM.</li>
</ol>
