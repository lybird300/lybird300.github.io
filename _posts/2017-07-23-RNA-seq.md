<h2>Basics</h2>
“Read” refers to both single-end or paired-end reads. The concept of counting is the same with either type of read, as each read represents a fragment that was sequenced. “Feature” refers to an expression feature, which is a genomic region containing a sequence that can normally appear in an RNA-Seq experiment (e.g. gene, isoform, exon).

Finally, I use the random variable X_i to denote the counts you observe from a feature of interest i. Unfortunately, with alternative splicing you do not directly observe X_i, so often \mathbb E[X_i] is used, which is estimated using the EM algorithm by a method like eXpress, RSEM, Sailfish, Cufflinks, or one of many other tools. 
<h2>RNA-seq expression measures</h2>
FPKM is very similar to RPKM. RPKM was made for single-end RNA-seq, where every read corresponded to a single fragment that was sequenced. FPKM was made for paired-end RNA-seq. With paired-end RNA-seq, two reads can correspond to a single fragment, or, if one read in the pair did not map, one read can correspond to a single fragment. The only difference between RPKM and FPKM is that FPKM takes into account that two reads can map to one fragment (and so it doesn’t count this fragment twice).
