To me, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the most intriguing component of data science. It is somewhat like autopsy -- both try to reveal the underlying story -- except that the goal of EDA is to revitalize the data. The task becomes even exiting when the data file to be inspected has unknown structure and huge size. We were looking for the simuated data Daniel created using CoJava and eventually found them (or part of them) yesterday. And it is now my job to interpret the data, which include some really big files. There are a 1.82GB file named "output.hap-1.test" and a 15.8MB file named "output.pos-1". I have some clue about <a href="http://lybird300.github.io/2015/04/20/cojava-manual.html#anchor">the contents of these files</a>.
