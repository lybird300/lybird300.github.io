To me, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the most intriguing component of data science. It is somewhat like autopsy -- both try to reveal the underlying story -- except that the goal of EDA is to revitalize the data. The task becomes even exiting when the data file to be inspected has unknown structure and huge size.
