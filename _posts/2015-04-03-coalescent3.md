The coalescent-with-recombination is conventionally described as a stochastic process in time [21], but Wiuf and Hein [36] showed that it could be reformulated as a mathematically equivalent process along the genome sequence. Unlike the process in time, this “sequential” process is not Markovian because long-range dependencies are induced by so-called “trapped” sequences (genetic material nonancestral to the sample flanked by ancestral segments). As a result, the full sequential process is complex and computationally expensive to manipulate. Interestingly, however, simulation processes that simply disregard the non-Markovian features of the sequential process produce collections of sequences that are remarkably consistent in most respects with those generated by the full coalescent-with-recombination [37], [38]. In other words, the coalescent-with-recombination is almost Markovian, in the sense that the long-range correlations induced by trapped material are fairly weak and have a minimal impact on the data.
