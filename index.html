        		<h1>A Social Scientist's Journey to Computational Genomics</h1>
<blockquote>“It is good to have an end to journey toward; but it is the journey that matters, in the end.” ― Ernest Hemingway</blockquote>
				<p>April 1st, 2015 (April Fool) is the day that I started as a post-doc research associate in the Department of Genetics at the School of Medicine in University of North Carilina at Chapel Hill. The person bold enough to hire me for this job, Dr. Kirk Wilhelmsen, stopped by after lunch. “Whatever you don’t know, I will teach you,” this world-known geneticist and neurologist said when he left. “Geez,” I said to myself, “you'd better not screw up.”</p>
