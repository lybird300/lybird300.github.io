	<p>I'm a Chinese citizen. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from two prestigious Chinese universities and my Ph.D. degree in information Science from University of Washington (see my <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/yuanlinly">LinkedIn page</a>). Shortly after that I joined Dr. Kirk Wilhelmsen's lab in the Department of Genetics at UNC Chapel Hill as a post-doc research associate. My current research interests include. Sadly I don't have many publications (see my <a href="http://tinyurl.com/scholarYLin">Google Scholar site</a>) but I'm working on it.</p>

	<p>Yuan Lin is currently a post-doc research associate in Department of Genetics, School of Medicine at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill). She is interested in computer simulation, network theories, and big data. Currently she is helping develop and test CHAT, a computer program originally written by Dr. Kirk Wilhelmsen that detects rare moderate penetrant mutations from GWA data</p>
	<p>I don't have ambicious goals. I've been trying to find something that I can hold on for a while, that I can think about everyday, that I can talk about without feeling bored. And I hope it is also something that other people consider meaningful and useful. Simple as that.</p>
