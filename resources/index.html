<div class="blurb">
<p>Below is a list of resources that I collected from Internet when teaching myself machine learning. Most of them are links to specific course websites. You may want to check different versions of the same course (i.e., offered in different academic years)</p>

<h2>Online courses</h2>
<p><b>Machine learning</b> by <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/">Andrew Ng(Stanford)</a> (also check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599">Youtube playlist of this course</a>), <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/10701_sp11/">Tom Mitchell (CMU)</a>(more Bayesian, highly recommend his video lectures), <a href="http://machine-learning-course.joachims.org/">Thorsten Joachims (Cornell)</a>, <a href="http://alex.smola.org/teaching/cmu2013-10-701/">Alex Smola(CMU)</a>(a PhD level Introduction to Machine Learning with TA recitation), <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse546/14au/">Carlos Guestrin(UW, highly recommended)</a>, and <a href="http://www.jennwv.com/courses/F11.html">Jenn Wortman Vaughan's lecture notes on theoretical machine learning </a> (Microsoft)</p>

<h2>For Fun</h2>
Poem by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-wE1dtwAAAAJ&hl=en">Bryan howie</a>, originally from <a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~howie/monomorphism.html">here</a>
You're Like a Monomorphic SNP
[breakup letter to a geneticist]
------------------------------------------

You're like a monomorphic SNP
in more ways than just one
you want to be my lone allele
and stop my polymorphic fun

These days I am finding you
quite difficult to call
I think you're causing my disease
but it's probably just my fault

You may have been selected
at some point in the past
But it's too late to fix you
'cause old alleles don't last

You're like a monomorphic SNP
a contradiction through and through
You say that I've changed since we met
well perhaps you should have too

I just want more clusters, baby
to adorn this scattered plot
I need a common risk allele
which is everything you're not

But wait...look there! Do I detect
some heterozygous shading?
Alas, no luck; just like our love
your DNA's degrading

<h2>Tips</h2>
<h3>Java</h3>
<a href="http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0180__File/SettingDelimitersforScanner.htm">Setting Delimiters for Scanner</a>
Get a complete absolute path from where your application was initialized: System.getProperty("user.dir")

Great <a href="http://winterbe.com/posts/2015/04/07/java8-concurrency-tutorial-thread-executor-examples/">tutorial</a> on how to execute Java code in parallel via threads, tasks and executor services

A fast way to read a huge file into memory: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9093888/fastest-way-of-reading-relatively-huge-byte-files-in-java?lq=1">using memory mapping</a> 

<h3>Unix/Linux</h3>

<h3>MobaXterm</h3>
MObaTextEditor will show the row # and col # of a data point if you put cursor on it.

<h3>Elicpse Java IDE</h3>
To compare two files in Eclipse, first select them in the Project Explorer with control-click. Then right-click on one of the files, and the following context menu will appear. Select Compare With / Each Other.

Eclipse allows you to split an editor and move it to anywhere in the editor area in the same window, including next to the original editor. Changes made in the one editor are reflected in the other. Select Window -> Editor and then choose what you want from the menu.

If you accidentally deleted a debug configuration and want it back. You can check whehter the machine you were using has backup (or snapshot) for the following folder: (path to your workspace)/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.debug.core/.launches
